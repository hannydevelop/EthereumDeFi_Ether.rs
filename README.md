# EthereumDeFi_Ethers.rs

This is a quick examples for newbies to illustrate transfer from one account to another in Ethereum (from my series: Building DeFi with Rust and Ethereum). This sample is inspired by the [examples](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/tree/master/ethers/examples) on ethers.rs. 
It utilizes the [ethers.rs](https://crates.io/crates/ethers) crate which is very similar to the ethers.js library for JavaScript developers. This crate is very lightweight and lot's of Dapps are exploring ethers.js over Web3.rs which is kind of bulky.

Follow the step below to get this example running in your working environment
- Install and set-up [Ganache CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli) in your working environment
- Clone this repository by running the command below:

```
git clone https://github.com/hannydevelop/EthereumDeFi_Ether.rs.git
```

- Run the command below in your terminal to start your application.

```
cargo run
```

- Feel free to reach out to me if you have any problem setting up this example. Otherwise, contact the ethers.rs team, there are amazing people to help.
